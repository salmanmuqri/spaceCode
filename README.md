## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The front-end technologies for creating the user interface and functionality.
- **CodeMirror**: A versatile JavaScript library for editing code with syntax highlighting and other features.
- **JSZip**: A library for creating zip archives to allow the user to download all files at once.

## File Structure

The project is a simple front-end application, so there is only one HTML file:

- **index.html**: The main file that contains the structure, styles, and JavaScript functionality for SpaceCode.

## Future Improvements

- **Add More Language Support**: Currently, the editor supports JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. More languages can be added in the future.
- **Auto-Save**: Implement a feature to auto-save the files periodically.
- **Cloud Storage**: Integrate cloud storage to save files remotely.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to sign in and save their files securely.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- **No File Opens When Clicking**: Ensure that you have saved any changes to the current file before opening another file.
- **Editor Not Working**: Refresh the page or try opening it in another browser.
- **Download Issues**: If the download link doesn't work, make sure pop-ups are allowed in your browser.
